# CI for MBSE internship

A repository to try to implement Continuous Integration for Model Based Languages.

In BasicAntProject I try to understand how github manages continuous integration for a basic java project:
  - Merging and versioning
  - automatic testing with ant xml files via github actions

Now I try to see how it can be applied to Model Based Languages like Tina.
